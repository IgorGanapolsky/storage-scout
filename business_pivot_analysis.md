## 2. Fully Autonomous Digital Income Streams

These require ZERO physical presence once set up.

### Option A: Price Arbitrage Alert Service

You already have infrastructure in this repo that can be reused.

```
Architecture:
├── GitHub Actions (free cron jobs)
├── Python scrapers (Patchright/Playwright)
├── ntfy.sh alerts → Telegram bot
├── Subscription via Stripe ($10-20/month)
└── Auto-fulfillment webhooks
```

**Markets to monitor:**
- Crypto arbitrage (CoinGecko API - free)
- Retail clearance (Home Depot, Lowes sales)
- Prediction markets (Polymarket spreads)
- Domain flipping (expired domains)

**Revenue:** 50 subscribers × $10/month = $500/month

### Option B: AI-Generated Digital Products

```
Workflow (fully automated):
1. Claude API generates product weekly
2. GitHub Actions uploads to Gumroad
3. Stripe webhook delivers on purchase
4. Email drip for upsells

Products:
- Prompt template packs ($7-15)
- Code snippet libraries ($10-25)
- Business calculators ($15-30)
- Notion/Sheets templates ($10-20)
```

**Revenue:** 100 products × 2 sales/month × $12 avg = $2,400/month potential

### Option C: Micro-SaaS Agents

Deploy Claude-powered bots that solve specific problems:

```
Examples:
- Email response generator ($20/month)
- Meeting notes summarizer ($15/month)
- Customer support analyzer ($25/month)
- Content repurposer ($15/month)
```

**Revenue:** 30 customers × $20/month = $600/month

## 6. Action Items - ZERO UPFRONT COST MODEL

**NEW WAY (zero investment until sale):**
1. Agent finds deal → Auto-lists virtual inventory
2. Customer books → You get profit alert
3. ONLY THEN buy the tool → Fulfill rental
4. First rental pays for tool + profit
