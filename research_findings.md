# Storage Arbitrage Research Findings

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Goal:** Find viable path to $30/day ($900/month) profit
**Location Focus:** Broward County, FL (Coral Springs area)

---

## Executive Summary

**Regular 10x20 storage arbitrage does NOT work in Coral Springs.** However, there are THREE viable paths to $900+/month:

| Strategy | Monthly Income | Capital Required | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Direct Host (RV/Driveway) | $500-700/space | $0 (own property) | Low |
| Direct Host (Garage) | $200-400/mo | $0 (own property) | Low |
| RV/Boat Arbitrage | $100-223/unit | $47-100/mo lease | Medium |
| Digital Services | $900+/mo | <$100 | Medium |

**RECOMMENDED PATH:** Direct Host Model on Neighbor.com

## 1. Why Regular Storage Arbitrage Failed

### The Math That Doesn't Work

| Item | Coral Springs Reality |
|------|----------------------|
| Commercial 10x20 rate | $183-501/mo |
| P2P 5x5 rate on Neighbor | $40-45/mo (NOT $65 as assumed) |
| Calculated Spread | (4 x $45) - $183 - $12 = **-$15/mo** |

**Conclusion:** The P2P market is oversaturated. Renters can find 5x5 units for $40-45/mo, making the arbitrage math impossible.

## 2. RV/Boat Storage Analysis (VIABLE)

### Commercial Rates Found

| Facility | Location | Size | Monthly Rate |
|----------|----------|------|--------------|
| Extra Space Storage | Coral Springs | RV spot | $47+ |
| Crystal Lake Outdoor | Pompano Beach | Boat/RV | ~$100 |
| A1 Outdoor Storage | Deerfield Beach | 10x44 | $96 |
| Garnett Storage | Coral Springs | Boat/RV | Market rate |

### P2P RV/Boat Rates on Neighbor.com

| Type | Fort Lauderdale Avg | Miami Avg |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| RV Storage | $282/mo | $350/mo |
| Boat Storage | $215/mo | $350/mo (indoor) |
| Outdoor uncovered | $93/mo | N/A |

### Arbitrage Calculation (RV)

```
Lease: $47-100/mo (commercial outdoor)
Rent on Neighbor: $215-282/mo
Gross Spread: $115-235/mo per space
Insurance/overhead: ~$12/mo
Net Spread: $103-223/mo per space
```

**To reach $900/mo:** Need 4-9 RV spaces

### Challenges
- Finding commercial facilities willing to sublease
- Managing multiple units
- Insurance/liability concerns
- Seasonal demand fluctuations

## 3. Direct Host Model (BEST OPTION)

### What You Can Earn on Neighbor.com

| Space Type | Monthly Income | Effort |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Driveway (400 sq ft) | $500/mo avg | Very Low |
| Large garage | $200-400/mo | Very Low |
| Outdoor boat space | $150/mo | Very Low |
| RV parking spot | $150-300/mo | Very Low |

### Why This Works

1. **Zero commercial lease cost** - Use your own property
2. **$1M liability guarantee** from Neighbor
3. **Passive income** - Neighbor handles payments, averages $294/hr of work
4. **Florida demand** - Strong market for RV/boat storage year-round
5. **No subletting restrictions** - You own the space

### Income Scenarios

**Scenario A: Single Driveway**
- Rent driveway for RV storage: $500/mo
- Neighbor fee (4.9% + $0.30): ~$25/mo
- **Net income: $475/mo**

**Scenario B: Driveway + Garage**
- Driveway RV space: $500/mo
- Garage storage: $200/mo
- Total gross: $700/mo
- Fees: ~$35/mo
- **Net income: $665/mo**

**Scenario C: Multiple Spaces**
- 2 outdoor RV/boat spots: $300/mo each = $600
- 1 garage: $200/mo
- Total gross: $800/mo
- **Net income: $760/mo**

### Real Florida Success Stories

## 4. Alternative Markets Analysis

### Palm Beach County
- Self storage average: $91.59/mo
- Strong demand from NY/NJ transplants
- Tax-friendly market attracting financial services
- **Verdict:** Similar rates to Broward, not significantly better

### Miami-Dade
- Indoor boat storage: $350/mo avg
- RV storage: Higher demand
- **Verdict:** Higher rates but also higher commercial costs

### Conclusion
No nearby market offers significantly better arbitrage spreads for traditional storage. The Direct Host model works equally well anywhere in South Florida.
