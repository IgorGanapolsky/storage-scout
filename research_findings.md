# Storage Arbitrage Research Findings

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Goal:** Find viable path to $30/day ($900/month) profit
**Location Focus:** Broward County, FL (Coral Springs area)

---

## Executive Summary

**Regular 10x20 storage arbitrage does NOT work in Coral Springs.** However, there are THREE viable paths to $900+/month:

| Strategy | Monthly Income | Capital Required | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Direct Host (RV/Driveway) | $500-700/space | $0 (own property) | Low |
| Direct Host (Garage) | $200-400/mo | $0 (own property) | Low |
| RV/Boat Arbitrage | $100-223/unit | $47-100/mo lease | Medium |
| Digital Services | $900+/mo | <$100 | Medium |

**RECOMMENDED PATH:** Direct Host Model on Neighbor.com

## 1. Why Regular Storage Arbitrage Failed

### The Math That Doesn't Work

| Item | Coral Springs Reality |
|------|----------------------|
| Commercial 10x20 rate | $183-501/mo |
| P2P 5x5 rate on Neighbor | $40-45/mo (NOT $65 as assumed) |
| Calculated Spread | (4 x $45) - $183 - $12 = **-$15/mo** |

**Conclusion:** The P2P market is oversaturated. Renters can find 5x5 units for $40-45/mo, making the arbitrage math impossible.

### Arbitrage Calculation (RV) - CLEAR PATH TO $30/DAY

**Option A: Land Lease Model (BEST)**
```
Lease 1 acre of land: $500-1,000/mo
Spots per acre (20×10 each): 15-20 spots
P2P Revenue per spot: $150/mo avg
Total Revenue (15 spots): $2,250/mo
Costs (lease + insurance): $600/mo
Net Profit: $1,650/mo = $55/day ✓
```

**Option B: Bulk Commercial Sublease**
```
Lease 10 outdoor spots @ $50/mo: $500/mo
P2P Revenue @ $175/mo: $1,750/mo
Net Spread: $1,250/mo = $42/day ✓
```

**Option C: Partner Aggregation (Zero Capital)**
```
Partner with 12 homeowners (driveways/lots)
P2P Rate per space: $150/mo avg
Total Revenue: $1,800/mo
Your 50% share: $900/mo = $30/day ✓
```

### Key Insight: Outdoor Uncovered = Best Margins
- Commercial outdoor uncovered: $30-50/mo
- P2P outdoor uncovered: $135-175/mo
- **Spread: $85-145/mo per spot**

### Challenges
- Finding commercial facilities willing to sublease
- Managing multiple units
- Insurance/liability concerns (Neighbor covers $1M)
- Seasonal demand fluctuations (mitigated in FL)
- Zoning requirements for storage use
