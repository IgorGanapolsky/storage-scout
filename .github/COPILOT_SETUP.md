# GitHub Copilot Setup Checklist

This document lists the manual GitHub settings you need to configure to fully enable all Copilot features.

## Required Plan

**GitHub Copilot Pro ($10/month)** is sufficient for all features below.

---

## Settings to Enable

### 1. Enable Copilot Memory (Agentic Memory)

> Allows Copilot to learn repository-specific patterns and remember them across sessions.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/storage-scout/settings
2. Click **Code security and analysis** in the sidebar
3. Scroll to **GitHub Copilot**
4. Enable **"Allow Copilot to create memories for this repository"**

**Verification:** After a few interactions, check https://github.com/settings/copilot → Memories

---

### 2. Enable Copilot Coding Agent

> Allows you to assign GitHub issues directly to Copilot for autonomous implementation.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/storage-scout/settings
2. Click **Copilot** in the sidebar (or **Code security and analysis**)
3. Under "Copilot coding agent", enable:
   - **"Allow Copilot to open pull requests"**
   - **"Allow Copilot to push to branches"**

**Usage:**
- Assign an issue to `Copilot` (type `@copilot` in assignees)
- Or comment `@copilot implement this` on an issue
- Copilot creates a `copilot/` branch and opens a draft PR

---

### 3. Enable Automatic Copilot Code Review

> Copilot automatically reviews all PRs (in addition to Claude review).

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/storage-scout/settings
2. Click **Rules** → **Rulesets** in the sidebar
3. Create a new ruleset or edit existing
4. Under **Branch rules**, enable:
   - **"Automatically request Copilot code review"**
   - Optionally: **"Review new pushes"** and **"Review draft pull requests"**

**Note:** Each Copilot review consumes 1 premium request from your monthly quota.

---

## Files Created by This Setup

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Main Copilot instructions (read on every request) |
| `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` | Claude AI code review workflow |

---

## Verification

After enabling all settings, test:

1. **Memory:** Make a few Copilot Chat requests, then check if Copilot remembers project patterns
2. **Coding Agent:** Create a test issue and assign to `Copilot`
3. **Code Review:** Open a PR and verify Copilot requests review automatically
4. **Instructions:** In VS Code, ask Copilot about spread calculation - it should know the formula

---

## Troubleshooting

**Copilot not following instructions?**
- Verify `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists
- Check that the file is on the default branch (develop)

**Coding agent not working?**
- Ensure you have Copilot Pro or higher
- Check repository settings → Copilot → Agent is enabled
- Agent only works on issues, not PRs

**Memory not persisting?**
- Memory is in public preview, may have delays
- Memories expire after 28 days
- Check https://github.com/settings/copilot for memory management
