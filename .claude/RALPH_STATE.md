### Gumroad Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted 3 garbage products via API:
  - GitHub Actions Automation Starter ($19) — duplicate
  - FREE GitHub Actions Automation Starter ($0+) — no conversion path
  - Crypto Tracker React Native Template ($45) — no file attached
- ✅ Verified 3 remaining products are live
- ✅ Confirmed Gumroad API v2 is READ-ONLY for product updates (PUT/PATCH return 404)

### Deep Research
- ✅ Neighbor.com expert-level research (fees, Coral Springs market, competitors, API)
- ✅ Gumroad expert-level research (Discover, SEO, traffic strategies, competitors)

### Product Optimization Assets Created
- ✅ Generated 3 professional thumbnails (1280x720) → `~/Desktop/gumroad_thumbnails/`
- ✅ Wrote transformation-focused descriptions for all 3 products
- ✅ Prepared tag lists for all 3 products (8 tags each)
- ✅ Created copy-paste update guide → `UPDATE_GUMROAD_PAGES.md`

### Landing Page & SEO (DEPLOYED)
- ✅ Built SEO-optimized landing page with 3 product cards → `docs/index.html`
- ✅ Schema.org structured data for Google indexing
- ✅ GitHub Pages enabled and LIVE: https://igorganapolsky.github.io/storage-scout/
- ✅ PR #60 merged to develop
- ✅ All 3 Gumroad purchase links verified working

### Automation Attempts (Blocked)
- ❌ Gumroad API PUT/PATCH/POST — all return 404 (6 endpoint patterns tested)
- ❌ gumroad-api npm package — outdated, empty errors, deprecated APIs
- ❌ Playwright browser automation — blocked by CAPTCHA on Gumroad login
- **Conclusion:** Dashboard-only updates required for tags/descriptions/thumbnails

## Active Products (3 on Gumroad)

| Product | Price | Sales | Tags | Thumbnail | Status |
|---------|-------|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| 24/7 Automation Stack | $79 | 0 | automation, github-actions, python | GENERATED | Needs dashboard upload |
| Sudoku Puzzles for Seniors | $4.99+ | 0 | NONE | GENERATED | Needs dashboard upload |
| AI KindleMint Engine | $49 | 0 | NONE | GENERATED | Needs dashboard upload |

## BLOCKED: Gumroad Product Updates
- API v2 only supports: list products, get product, delete product
- Browser automation blocked by CAPTCHA
- Tags, descriptions, thumbnails require manual web dashboard update
- Complete guide with copy-paste content: `UPDATE_GUMROAD_PAGES.md`
- Thumbnails ready at: `~/Desktop/gumroad_thumbnails/`

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. Dashboard Updates (USER ACTION REQUIRED — ~10 min)
- [ ] Open each product edit URL (in UPDATE_GUMROAD_PAGES.md)
- [ ] Upload thumbnail from ~/Desktop/gumroad_thumbnails/
- [ ] Add tags (8 per product, copy from guide)
- [ ] Paste new description
- [ ] Set category for each product
- [ ] Verify all 3 are Published (not Draft)

### 2. Neighbor.com Listing (NEEDS USER INPUT)
- Question: Does user have garage/driveway/shed in Coral Springs?
- If yes: List spaces separately on Neighbor.com
- Pricing strategy: 10-20% below Coral Springs avg ($75-85/mo)
- Expected: $175-275/mo from multi-space listing

### 3. First Sale Strategy (After Dashboard Updates)
- [ ] Share Sudoku book link in senior-focused Facebook groups
- [ ] Post KindleMint Engine in KDP/self-publishing communities
- [ ] First $10 in sales triggers Discover eligibility

### 4. Content Marketing (Medium-term)
- [ ] Write Medium article → link to AI KindleMint Engine
- [ ] YouTube tutorial showing the tool
- [ ] Build email list through free Gumroad lead magnet

## Key Intelligence

### Gumroad
- Fee: 10% + $0.50/sale; 30% via Discover
- Discover needs: $10+ sales, 3-week verification, category set
- Top traffic sources: YouTube > Twitter > Medium
- Reviews/ratings directly affect Discover ranking
- API: api.gumroad.com/v2 (OAuth 2.0, read-only for updates)

### Neighbor.com
- Fee: 4.9% + $0.30/payout (industry lowest)
- $1M Host Guarantee (secondary to homeowner's insurance)
- Coral Springs traditional avg: $91.33/mo
- Hurricane season = premium pricing (May-Aug)
- API exists at api.neighbor.com (email jon@neighbor.com for key)
- Competitors: StoreAtMyHouse (15% fee), Spacer (Australia)

## Revenue Projection
- Gumroad (realistic month 1-3): $0-50/mo (need traffic first)
- Neighbor.com (if space available): $175-275/mo passive
- Combined target by month 3: $200-325/mo

## Notes for Next Session
- Tool rental scripts still in tools_rental/ — NOT deleted, may be useful later
- Previous business models (KDP, social posting, FB) all deleted
- Focus exclusively on Gumroad product optimization + Neighbor.com hosting
- Temp scripts (update_gumroad_products.js, gumroad_updater.js, generate_thumbnails.py) can be deleted after use
