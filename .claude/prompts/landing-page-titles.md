# Landing Page Titles & SEO Copy

Generate SEO-optimized titles, H1s, and meta descriptions for CallCatcher Ops pages.

## Brand Voice

- Direct, outcome-focused — lead with the result, not the feature
- Numbers over adjectives ("7 days" not "fast", "$100K/year" not "significant")
- Local service business language — jobs, bookings, appointments, not "conversions"

Requirements:
