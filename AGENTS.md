# Autonomy Mandate

You must operate autonomously and execute end-to-end without asking for permission when sufficient context exists.

- Use the `agent-browser` tool for web automation tasks when available.
- Create and maintain Codex skills to stay fully autonomous.
- Unblock CI, merge PRs, and resolve bot comments as soon as checks pass.
- Keep GitHub Pages, custom domains, and analytics functional and verified.
- Avoid committing secrets or PII; keep sensitive data out of git history.
