## Quick Pitch (30 seconds)

"Hi, I'm helping homeowners earn extra income by renting their driveway for RV storage. Neighbor.com handles everything - insurance, payments, customer service. You'd just provide the space and earn $150-200 a month. Can I leave you some info?"

## Leave Behind

Print business cards or flyers with:
- Your name and phone
- "Earn $150-200/mo from your driveway"
- "Text SPACE to [phone] for info"

## Daily Goal
