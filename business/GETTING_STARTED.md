## Step 2: Scout Oakland Park for Partners (Weekend Activity)

### Target Areas (High RV/Boat Ownership)
- NE 38th St to NE 56th St (near Prospect Rd)
- Along NW 21st Ave (larger lots)
- Near Middle River (boat owners nearby)

### What to Look For
✅ Houses with long driveways (20+ feet)
✅ Side yards with gate access
✅ Empty RV/boat pads (they know the market)
✅ "For Rent" signs (motivated owners)

### Approach Script (Door Knock)
> "Hi, I'm [Name]. I help homeowners earn $150-200/month by renting their driveway for RV or boat storage through Neighbor.com. They handle insurance and payments - you'd just provide the space. Would you be interested in learning more?"

## Step 3: Partner Outreach Template

### Email/Text Template
```
Subject: Earn $150-200/mo from your driveway (no work required)

Hi [Name],

I noticed you have a great driveway/side yard that could earn you passive income.

I help homeowners list their space on Neighbor.com for RV and boat storage. Here's how it works:

- You provide the space
- I handle all the listing, photos, and customer communication
- Neighbor.com handles payments and provides $1M liability insurance
- We split the income 50/50

Typical earnings: $150-200/month for a standard driveway spot.

Interested? I can come by this week to take photos and get you set up.

Best,
[Your Name]
