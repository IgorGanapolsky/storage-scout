# Phone Script (Med Spas) — Free Baseline

## Goal
- Book a 10-minute baseline call OR run a 5-minute baseline on the spot.
- Get the owner's first name + direct email + best callback number.

## Opener (Gatekeeper)
1. "Hi, quick question. Who handles new patient consult bookings there, the owner or manager?"
2. If transferred: "Thanks. This is Igor. I'm local and I'm calling about missed calls turning into missed consults."

## 20-Second Pitch (Owner/Manager)
"We help med spas capture missed calls after-hours and during busy times with a simple text-back + callback workflow. I can run a free 5-minute baseline for {ClinicName} to estimate how many consults are slipping through and what it's worth. No commitment."

## Ask
- "Do you have 5 minutes now, or should we schedule a 10-minute baseline call?"
- If schedule: "Easiest is this link: https://callcatcherops.com/callcatcherops/intake.html"

## Baseline Questions (5 Minutes)
- "Roughly how many inbound calls per day?"
- "How many consult requests per week come by phone?"
- "After-hours: do you have someone answering or voicemail?"
- "When a caller hangs up, do you text them back today?"
- "What's a typical consult value or first-visit value?"

## If They Say "Email Me"
- "Happy to. What's the best direct email for you (not info@)?"
- Send:
  - baseline example PDF: https://callcatcherops.com/callcatcherops/baseline-example.pdf
  - intake link: https://callcatcherops.com/callcatcherops/intake.html

## Common Objections
- "We don't miss calls."
  - "Totally. During lunch / treatments / after 5pm, what happens if two people call at once?"
- "We have an answering service."
  - "Great. Do they text back missed calls and confirm consult slots, or do they just take a message?"
- "Not interested."
  - "No worries. Is missed calls just not a problem for you, or do you already have automation in place?"

## Close (What You Want)
- "Can I send the baseline today if you share 2 numbers: calls/day and average consult value?"
- "If it looks meaningful, we can run a 7-day pilot and you can keep it only if it works."
