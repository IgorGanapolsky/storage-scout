**Cold Email 1 (Initial)**
Subject: Quick fix for missed calls at {{BusinessName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Noticed {{BusinessName}} takes calls from new customers. Most local teams miss 20–35% of inbound calls after hours or during rushes. We install missed-call text-back + call-back automations that recover those leads in under a week.

Want a free 10‑minute baseline showing how many leads you’re losing and what recovery would look like?

**Cold Email 2 (Follow‑up, Day 3)**
Subject: Example recovery numbers for {{BusinessName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up. If you average {{CallVolume}} inbound calls/day, recovering even 3–5 missed calls/week typically covers the monthly fee. I can run the baseline and send the results.

Should I send the baseline template?

**Cold Email 3 (Day 7)**
Subject: Close the loop

Hi {{FirstName}},

If missed calls aren’t a priority right now, no worries. If you want the baseline later, reply “baseline” and I’ll send it over.
