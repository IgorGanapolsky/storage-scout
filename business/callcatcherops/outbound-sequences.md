## Step 1 — Day 1: The Audit Offer

**Subject:** Tried reaching your office today

**Body:**

Hi {{name}},

Called {{company}} earlier — went to voicemail after several rings. No big deal, but it got me thinking.

We run free 1-page missed-call reports for dental offices showing exactly how many calls go unanswered each week and what that costs in new patient revenue.

Want yours? Takes us 48 hours and costs you nothing.

## Step 2 — Day 4: The Insight

**Subject:** Re: Tried reaching your office today

**Body:**

Hi {{name}},

Quick follow-up — studies show 42% of dental patients who hit a voicemail call a competitor instead.

That's nearly half your inbound calls potentially walking out the door.

Our free audit shows your actual missed-call rate in 48 hours. Still happy to run one for {{company}} if you're curious.

Just closing the loop on the free missed-call report for {{company}}.

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. If you'd like to grab a quick 15-minute call, here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Either way, wish you a busy schedule.
