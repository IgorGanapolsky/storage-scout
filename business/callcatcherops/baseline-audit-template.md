# Baseline Audit Template (5-10 Minutes)

## Inputs (Ask On The Phone)
- Business name:
- Contact name + role:
- Best callback number:
- Direct email (not info@):
- Calls/day (rough):
- % calls that go to voicemail or unanswered (rough):
- After-hours coverage: (none / voicemail / answering service / staff)
- Avg consult value (or avg first-visit value):
- Typical time-to-book (same day / 1-3 days / 1+ weeks):
- Current tools (if any): (GoHighLevel, Podium, Weave, NexHealth, etc.)

## Quick Math (Write Down)
- Missed calls/day = calls/day * missed_rate
- Missed calls/week = missed calls/day * 7
- Potential consults/week = missed calls/week * (conservative conversion rate)
  - start with 10% if you don't know
- Potential revenue/week = potential consults/week * avg consult value

## Baseline Output (What You Send)
1. "Here's the conservative baseline leak (range): $X-$Y per week."
2. "If we recover even Z% of missed calls, it pays for itself."
3. "Next step: 7-day pilot with missed-call text back + callback workflow."

## What "Pilot" Means (No Tech Jargon)
- When a call is missed, the caller gets a polite text in under 60 seconds.
- If they reply, the team gets notified and can call back fast.
- We track: missed calls, response time, booked consults.
