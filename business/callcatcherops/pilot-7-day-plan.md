# 7-Day Pilot Plan (First Client)

## Goal
Prove one thing: "Missed calls -> fast response -> booked consults."

## Success Metrics (Pick 2-3)
- Missed calls responded to within 5 minutes
- Booked consults attributable to missed-call follow-up
- Reduction in "voicemail-only" outcomes

## Day 0 (Baseline)
- Confirm call volume, after-hours coverage, consult value
- Agree on pilot success metrics
- Collect:
  - primary phone line(s)
  - business hours
  - who receives notifications
  - approved text copy (and opt-out language)

## Days 1-2 (Setup + Test)
- Implement missed-call text-back and callback workflow using the client's existing tools when possible.
- Run end-to-end test: place a call, miss it, confirm text fires, confirm notification routing works.
- Confirm opt-out keywords and quiet hours behavior.

## Days 3-7 (Monitor + Improve)
- Daily check:
  - missed-call count
  - response time
  - conversations started
  - consults booked
- Adjust copy and routing once based on real results (no constant tinkering).

## Conversion (After Pilot)
- If metrics improved: offer paid rollout (kickoff + monthly) with pilot settings retained.
- If metrics did not improve: stop and learn why (coverage issue vs lack of demand vs workflow mismatch).
