### Value Proposition

When a homeowner calls and you can't pick up, our system instantly texts them back: "Hey, we got your call — what do you need help with?"

## Allowable Cost Per Lead Calculation

### Revenue Model

| Tier | Revenue | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **QuickStart Build** | $1,500 | One-time setup fee |
| **AI Workflow Subscription** (12 months) | $5,964 | $497/month recurring |
| **Total LTV (Subscription client)** | **$7,464** | $1,500 + $5,964 |

### Lead Economics

| Metric | Conservative | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| LTV | $7,464 | $7,464 |
| Close Rate | 10% | 20% |
| Revenue per Lead | $746 | $1,492 |
| Target Margin (after ad cost) | ≥ 50% | ≥ 50% |
| **Allowable Cost Per Lead** | **$75** | **$150** |

### Recommendation

> **Start at $75/lead cap.** This gives a 10x safety margin on LTV at a conservative 10% close rate. As conversion data comes in (aim for 30+ lead sample size), increase toward $100–$150/lead if close rates exceed 15%. Track cost-per-booked-call and cost-per-closed-deal separately — the intake form is the conversion event, not the click.

### Budget Guidance
- **Test budget**: $500–$1,000 (gets ~7–13 leads at $75 cap)
- **Scale budget**: $2,000–$5,000/month once unit economics are validated
- **Break-even**: 1 subscription close per month covers ~$500/month in ad spend at 10x ROI
