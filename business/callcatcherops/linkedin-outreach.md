## Step 1 — Connection Request

**Message (under 300 chars):**

Hi {{name}} — I work with dental offices on missed-call audits. Noticed {{company}} and thought it might be relevant. Would love to connect.

## Step 2 — Day 2: Follow-Up After Connect

**Message:**

Thanks for connecting, {{name}}!

We help dental practices see exactly how many inbound calls go unanswered each week — and what that means for new patient revenue.

We offer a free 1-page missed-call report — no strings, just the data. Happy to run one for {{company}} if it sounds useful.

Let me know either way — no pressure.

## Step 3 — Day 5: Audit Offer

**Message:**

Hey {{name}}, circling back quickly.

We just finished an audit for a dental practice in [City] — they were losing roughly 11 calls a week to voicemail, averaging $4,400/month in missed new patient revenue.

Our free report shows the same picture for {{company}} in 48 hours.

If you'd like one, I can have it to you by end of week. Just say the word or grab time here: callcatcherops.com
